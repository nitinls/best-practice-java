Change Tracking	Change Data Capture
Creates a hidden, internal table so users can query the time and type of any change made to a row in the database table	Identifies and captures just the most recent production data and metadata changes, and then enables data replication software to copy those changes to a separate data repository
Only stores the most recent change to each row – doesn’t maintain change history	Maintains a history of row changes, including the actual data that was changed
Operates synchronously, so that change information is refreshed in real time, coincident with the incorporation of that change into the database	Asynchronously reading the database’s transaction log to detect when a change has occurred
